# Brick-Breaker
Brick Breaker is a classic game that I recreated in Java.

How to play:
- Hold down the left mouse button to move the platform at the bottom of the screen
- You must catch the moving ball on the platform
- If you don't catch the ball, you lose and the game will restart
- Objective of the game is to break as many bricks as you can at the top of the screen
- You only have one life, and as the game goes on the ball moves faster

Included in the game:
- A leveling system
- Music!
